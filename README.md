# Flask Blog

This is a simple blog website I made for a friend using **Flask**.  
It lets you write posts, edit them, and display them on a page. The design uses **Bootstrap 5** for styling.

## How it works

- Homepage lists all blog posts.  
- Click on a post to read it.  
- Forms to add or edit posts.  
- Posts are stored in a small SQLite database.

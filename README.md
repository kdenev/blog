Flask Blog

This is a simple blog website I made for a friend using Flask.
It lets you write posts, edit them, and show them on a page. The design uses Bootstrap 5 for styling.

How it works

There is a homepage that lists all blog posts.

You can click on a post to read it.

There are forms to add or edit posts.

The posts are stored in a small SQLite database.

How to run it

Install Python if you donâ€™t have it.

Install Flask:

pip install flask


Run the app:

flask run


Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
